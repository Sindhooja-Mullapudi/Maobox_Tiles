# Mapbox Tiles 
## Sindhooja Mullapudi

This map made from tiles was made to focus on India, specifically where I was born in India. This lab is a way to demonstrate a very basic tile, zoomable, interactive web map. The libraries are from open source softwares such as leaflet. There is a marker and popup to show where I was born in India that appear the second the map webpage is opened. 

This map has a zoom level of 5. Which means the tiles are broken into 5 different zoomable levels and are saved in our tiles folder. And because github can only hold certain amount of data, only the important data has been added.
